# Optimistic Navigation
That project exists because I set a goal for myself of creating a website that would have consistently fast navigation regardless of the Internet speed or CPU performance.

I could simply use prefetching to achieve my goal. But prefetching at scale is expensive and wasteful, so I decided to go the other way. Rather than preloading content, I attempted to create the illusion that it's already loaded. I call it "Optimistic Navigation."

Let's assume that data from the entity list request matches the data from the entity detail request. Then, when a user navigates from a page with an entity list to an entity detail page, the page can be rendered optimistically (synchronously) with data from the entity list. With that idea in mind, I was able to hide around 2 seconds of network latency during soft navigation.

Optimistic navigation has a positive impact on user engagement, SEO, and hosting bills. But to implement it, tight cooperation between the backend, frontend, and design teams is required.
